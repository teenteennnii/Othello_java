<h1>Othello Game</h1>
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Othello (Reversi) game. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other to capture and control the majority of the game board.

<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
1. The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their discs on the board.
3. A player's disc must be placed on an empty square such that it surrounds at least one of the opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. All of the opponent's discs that are trapped between the newly placed disc and any other discs of the current player are flipped and turned into the current player's color.
5. If a player cannot make a valid move, they must pass their turn.
6. The game ends when there are no empty squares left on the board or when neither player can make a valid move.
7. The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
1. Launch the game application.
2. The game board will be displayed, showing the initial setup.
3. Players will be prompted to enter their moves alternately.
4. Enter the row and column coordinates to place your disc on the board (e.g., "3 4").
5. The game will validate the move and update the board accordingly.
6. Continue taking turns until the game ends.
7. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw.
